# gesrotes-backend

Application in [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) for the educational and administrative management of the programs that make up the Faculty of Health at the University of Cauca, CO.

This project uses [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) to document the REST API. Swagger is an open-source tool that allows you to describe, produce, consume, and visualize RESTful services.
## Using Swagger
To access the documentation generated by Swagger, you can open your web browser and navigate to the route `/swagger-ui/index.html`. On this page, you'll find a user interface that will allow you to explore and test the REST API.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/co/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.unicauca.gesrotes.GesrotesApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Running using Docker

The Dockerfile template creates a Docker image for your application that:

* Use the `maven:3.6.1-jdk-11-slim` and `openjdk:11` images

The template also makes the following assumptions about your application:

* It timezone is ` America/Bogota`

You can change these settings by updating the Dockerfile.

### Building the Docker image for your application

After any required changes have been made to the Dockerfile, you can build a Docker image for your application using the following command:

```sh
docker build -t gesrotes-backend .
```
where `gesrotes-backend` is the name you want to give your created Docker image.

### Running the Docker image for your application
You can run it using either of the following commands:

* Run as an interactive application on your command line:
  ```sh
  docker run -i -p 8080:8080 -t gesrotes-backend
  ```
  This maps port 8080 in the Docker image to port 8080 on your machine. If you are using a different port, you will need to change the mapping.

* Run as a daemon process:
  ```sh
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -t gesrotes-backend
  ```
  This uses the `-d` flag rather than the `-i` flag to run the Docker image as a background task.
